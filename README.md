Hi, I'm a Computer Science Engineering student with an ever-curious mind and I believe every line of code I write brings me closer to solving real-world problems.  

Lately, I’ve found myself deeply immersed in the world of **data science** — and it resonates with me quite well.

As part of my learning journey, I had the opportunity to **intern at DRDO Dehradun**, focusing on **Network Automation and Cybersecurity**. There, I worked hands-on with **Kali Linux** and explored powerful tools like **Wireshark**, **Metasploit**, **Nmap** etc. Under the mentorship of experts, I successfully performed **two penetration testing assignments**, gaining invaluable exposure to real-world cybersecurity practices and ethical hacking techniques.

Beyond data science, I’ve dabbled in **front-end development** and can craft smooth, clean, and intuitive webpages. While I’m still learning and evolving, I like to believe I’m building something meaningful with every project I take on.

Here I am sharing projects, wins, and the bugs that teach the most.
