### 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm a Computer Science Engineering student with an ever-curious mind and a love for all things tech. I'm fluent in **Java, Python, and C**, and I believe every line of code I write brings me closer to solving real-world problems.  

Lately, I’ve found myself deeply immersed in the world of **data science** — and it just clicks. The patterns, the insights, the possibilities — it feels like a puzzle I was meant to solve.

As part of my learning journey, I had the opportunity to **intern at DRDO**, focusing on **Network Automation and Cybersecurity**. There, I worked hands-on with **Kali Linux** and explored powerful tools like **Wireshark**, **Metasploit**, and **Nmap**. Under the mentorship of experts, I successfully performed **two penetration testing assignments**, gaining invaluable exposure to real-world cybersecurity practices and ethical hacking techniques.

🧠 I enjoy turning raw data into meaningful stories, uncovering trends, and building models that do more than just crunch numbers — they bring clarity to complexity.  
_"In God we trust, all others must bring data."_

Beyond data science, I’ve dabbled in **front-end development** and can craft smooth, clean, and intuitive webpages. While I’m still learning and evolving, I like to believe I’m building something meaningful with every project I take on.

🛠️ Sharing projects, wins, and the bugs that teach the most. Let’s build, break, and learn together.
